# Restaurant

An app in which you can look at the menu of a restaurant.
The first screen lets you select the category of dishes you want to look at.
The second screen shows you the different dishes, when you click on one of those dishes you see the specifications of that dish on a third screen.
When you rotate your screen the app still works the way you want to.
